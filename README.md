# Billing System

One of the most popular projects for refining your Java programming skills is the billing system. The basic objective of this billing system project is to automatically compute bills, eliminating the need for manual calculations. You might want to start by creating a simple interface that requires the user to enter the invoice number, price per unit, and number of units.

The system will generate a bill based on these facts, including the actual amount that must be paid. The wonderful thing about creating a billing system project in Java is that you may change the project's level from amateur to advanced depending on your skills and requirements. You can, for instance, create more complicated projects such as grocery billing systems, apparel billing systems, or electricity billing systems.
